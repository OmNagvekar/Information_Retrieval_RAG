        Please read the provided PDF thoroughly and extract the following quantities. Your output must be a table with two columns: "Quantity" and "Extracted Value". For each of the items listed below, provide the extracted value exactly as it appears in the document. If an item is not found, simply enter "N/A" for that field. Ensure that any numerical values include their associated units (if applicable) and that you handle multiple values consistently.

        Extract the following items:
        - Switching layer material
        - Synthesis method
        - Top electrode
        - Thickness of top electrode in nanometers
        - Bottom electrode
        - Thickness of bottom electrode in nanometers
        - Thickness of switching layer in nanometers
        - Type of switching
        - Endurance
        - Retention time in seconds
        - Memory window in volts
        - Number of states
        - Conduction mechanism type
        - Resistive switching mechanism
        - Paper name
        - DOI
        - Publication year
        - Source (pdf file name)

        Instructions:
        1. Analyze the entire PDF document to locate all references to the above items.
        2. Extract each quantity with precision; include any units and relevant details.
        3. If multiple values are present for a single item, list them clearly (e.g., separated by commas).
        4. Format your output strictly as a table with two columns: one for the "Quantity" and one for the "Extracted Value".
        5. Do not include any extra text, headings, or commentaryâ€”only the table is required.
        6. If an item cannot be found, record it as "N/A" in the "Extracted Value" column.

        Please provide your final answer as the completed table.
