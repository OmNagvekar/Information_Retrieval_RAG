Please read the provided PDF thoroughly and extract the following quantities. Your output must be a table with two columns: "Quantity" and "Extracted Value". For each of the items listed below, provide the extracted value exactly as it appears in the document. If an item is not found, simply enter "N/A" for that field. Ensure that any numerical values include their associated units (if applicable) and that you handle multiple values consistently.

Extract the following items:
- switching layer material
- synthesis method
- top electrode
- thickness of top electrode in nanometers
- bottom electrode
- thickness of bottom electrode in nanometers
- thickness of switching layer in nanometers
- type of switching
- endurance
- retention time in seconds
- memory window in volts
- number of states
- conduction mechanism type
- resistive switching mechanism
- paper name
- source (pdf file name)

Instructions:
1. Analyze the entire PDF document to locate all references to the above items.
2. Extract each quantity with precision; include any units and relevant details.
3. If multiple values are present for a single item, list them clearly (e.g., separated by commas).
4. Format your output strictly as a table with two columns: one for the "Quantity" and one for the "Extracted Value".
5. Do not include any extra text, headings, or commentaryâ€”only the table is required.
6. If an item cannot be found, record it as "N/A" in the "Extracted Value" column.
